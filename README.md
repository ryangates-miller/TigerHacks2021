# TigerHacks2021
Welcome to my 2021 submission for TigerHacks!
The theme for this years hackathon was "space." 
My submission is a program that examines Keplar's laws in classical mechanics.

The statments of Kepler's laws are as follows:
|Kepler's Laws|
|-------------|
|1.Planets move in elliptical orbits with the sun at one focus.|
|2.The line joining planets to either focus sweeps out equal areas in equal times.|
|3.The square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (half the longer side of the ellipse):  T2∝a3.T^2|

Kepler originally developed these laws in relation to planetary orbits. 
However, their results hold true for any system with a radial force that 
obeys the inverse square law.
